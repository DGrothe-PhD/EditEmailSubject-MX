    <h1>Edit Email Subject: local mode deprecation</h1>
  </div>
  <div style="font-size:18px">
    <p>Since version 1.0, the default operation mode used by the <i>Edit Email Subject</i> add-on for changing the
      subject was to modify the local message database. This mode did not actually change the message.</p>

    <p>After IMAP servers became more popular, a new mode was introduced, which changed the subject in the
      message itself. This change was synchronized with the IMAP server and was therefore visible on all other IMAP
      clients connected to the same email account.</p>

    <p>During the last year it became obvious, that the local mode causes confusions:
    <ul>
      <li>the original subject is restored when message is moved/copied (applies to messages in local folders, POP
        folders and IMAP folders)</li>
      <li>the original subject is restored when folder is repaired (applies to messages in local folders, POP folders
        and IMAP folders)</li>
      <li>most of the time users are confused that the subject is not updated on all devices (applies to messages in
        IMAP folders)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>We therefore decided to drop support for the local mode and no longer modify the message database, but always
      update the message. Technically, the message is re-created with a new UUID and the updated subject. The original
      message is moved to a local folder named "EES-Backup", in case something went wrong.
